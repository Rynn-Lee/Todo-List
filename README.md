## 🤔 What's this project?
This is literally where my journey began<br>
This is my first ever project on JS, React and on github at all<br>
It's a simple TODO list. I made it with my friend who introduced me to React :з<br>
Well, i remade it recently and used NextJS instead of React itself, because it used some headless cms as a database that i don't have now.

## 💻 What tech stack is used?
Front-end: NextJS, Sass<br>
